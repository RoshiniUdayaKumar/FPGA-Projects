# FPGA-Projects
This repository features FPGA-based projects designed for the ZYBO-Z7 FPGA board, with coding in Verilog using the Vivado tool. 
Starting with a simple counter design, the project progresses toward building a custom hardware IP.

The board configuration file is included for reference.
### Files Required:  
- .v file (Verilog source code)  
- .xdc file (Xilinx Design Constraints file)  

ðŸ’¡ **Note:**  
The .xdc file specifies the mapping of hardware components like DIP switches and LEDs on the ZYBO-Z7 board. It defines which board pins are connected to specific signals in the Verilog code.  
For example, pin G15 on the board is connected to switch[0]. This file acts as a bridge between the Verilog design and the physical hardware, ensuring the correct connections.

### Project 1: Design a 4-bit up/down counter

## Step 1: Verify LED Functionality Based on Switch Inputs  
Start by checking if the LEDs illuminate in response to the corresponding switches being toggled.

## Step 2: Design a 4-bit Counter Using LEDs  
A counter is a sequential circuit that increments or decrements its value with each clock cycle. It can count up, down, or in both directions, depending on the control inputs. A clock signal is essential for its operation.

The clock signal available on the FPGA board is connected to the K17 pin and operates at a frequency of 125 MHz. At this speed, the LED changes occur too quickly for human observation. To make the LED transitions visible, a clock divider circuit can be used to reduce the clock frequency to a slower, observable rate.

For implementing an up-down counter, the FPGA board's in-built push buttons, BTN0 and BTN1, can be utilized:  
- BTN0: Activates the up-counter mode (increments the count).  
- BTN1: Activates the down-counter mode (decrements the count).  
- When neither button is pressed, the counter holds its current value.
